# Ownership of files

On the Sophia storage system there are two types of directories;
subdirectories for <u style="color:blue">**single-user data**</u> are under
`/home`, whereas subdirectories for <u style="color:green">**multi-user data**</u> are 
under `/groups`.

| <span style="color:blue">**private**</span> data    | <span style="color:green">**shared**</span> data       |
| ----------|----------------------|
| <span style="color:blue">`/home/<dtu user>`</span> | <span style="color:green">`/groups/<group name>`</span>  |

Multi-user directories must *never* contain personal user data (ssh keys, etc.).

If you would like to have a group directory created please write the address at
the bottom left.
